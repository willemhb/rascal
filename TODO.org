* TODO Middle development
The focus of versions 0.0.17 - 0.0.28 is to add the more sophisticated features that make
rascal distinctive. This phase is focused on basic implementations for these features, not
efficient implementations. Refinement will come later.

** TODO Version 0.0.17 - hashing & cacheing
*** Goals
This version is focused on the implementation of sophisticated hashing and comparison that 
works for all values and handles reference cycles in hashed data. These features will be 
needed for the development of more advanced features.

*** Target features
**** TODO `dict`, `set` types implemented
**** TODO `hash`, `eq?`, `ord` comparison and hashing primitives implemented

** TODO Version 0.0.18 - packages
*** Goals
Version 0.0.17 focuses on implementing the core of an extremely simple package system.

Packages are implemented on top of closures. Packages are the result of executing a file.

Packages are loaded at most once, and stored in the toplevel namespace.

*** Target features
**** TODO `require`, `provide` forms implemented
**** TODO `ns`, `var`, `pkg` types implemented
**** TODO `sym`, `module` types updated

** TODO Version 0.0.19 - macros
*** Goals
With the package system in place, Version 0.0.19 focuses on implementing the basic macro system.

**** TODO `macro-call?`, `macro-expand-1`, `macro-expand` macro primitives implemented
**** TODO `ns`, `var`, `pkg` types updated

** TODO Version 0.0.20 - backquote
*** Goals
Once macros and packages exist, it's time to improve the reader. Version 0.0.20 is focused on
extending the reader to support a `clojure`-like backquote form. Custom reader macros are
left for a later date.

A few other syntaxes are implemented for convenience.

*** Target features
**** TODO `~backquote`, `~@backquote`, `backquote#` syntaxes implemented
**** TODO `%(+ 1 %)` lambda literal syntax implemented

** TODO Version 0.0.21 - arity overloading, variadic functions, and splatting
*** Goals
As a first step toward true multi-methods, this version introduces overloading by function
arity and rest arguments. It also updates the `fun` and `mac` syntax to support multiple
signatures.

*** Target features
**** TODO `func` type implemented
**** TODO `(+ 1 2 .. '(3 4))` splatting syntax implemented
**** TODO overloading by function arity implemented (prelude to multimethods)

** TODO Version 0.0.22 - basic type annotations
*** Goals 
In order to allow dispatching on types, we need a syntax for annotating types. This update
focuses on meeting that requirement.

*** Target features
**** TODO `(<type> <var>)` type annotation syntax implemented
**** TODO annotation support implemented in `fun`, `mac`, `let`, and `def` forms
**** TODO runtime type checking implemented

** TODO Version 0.0.23 - true multimethods
*** Goals
With basic dispatch and variable types implemented, full multiple dispatch is added.

Fast dispatch is not the focus of this version.

*** Target features
**** TODO `method-table`, `method` types implemented
**** TODO multiple dispatch implemented in the interpreter

** TODO Version 0.0.24 - first class types
*** Goals
Support for user types requires types to be first class objects. Basic support for this is the 
focus of this update.

*** Target features
**** `type` form implemented
**** `data-type`, `alias-type` types implemented, integrated into object system

** TODO Version 0.0.25 - record types
*** Goals
With first class types in place, it's time to implement non-trivial user types. We start with
record types.

*** Target features
**** `type` form extended with support for `(type <name> {..<fields>})` syntax
**** `record`, `record-type` types implemented, integrated into object system

** TODO Version 0.0.26 - union types
Extend the type system to support unions.

** TODO Version 0.0.27 - continuations

** TODO Version 0.0.28 - first-class effects
*** Goals

* TODO Late development
At this point rascal is nearly ready to be public. Focus in this stage is on improving performance,
working on a standard library, and implementing features that are nice for usability but not essential
to development.

This would be the point in development when I might consider bringing in other people.

** TODO Version 0.0.29 - functional vec
*** Goals
Reimplement the `vec` type using persistent HAMTs.

*** Target features
**** TODO `vec-node` type added
**** TODO `vec` type updated

** TODO Version 0.0.30 - functional set
*** Goals
Same as above for `set`

*** Target features
**** TODO `set-node`, `set-leaf`, `set-leaves` types added
**** TODO `set` type updated

** TODO Version 0.0.31 - functional dict
*** Goals
Same as above for `dict`

** TODO Target features
**** TODO `dict-node`, `dict-leaf`, `dict-leaves` types added
**** TODO `dict` type updated

** TODO Version 0.0.31 - sequences & collections
*** Goals
With multimethods implemented, we can implement a generic interface for sequences.

** TODO Target features
**** TODO `list` type implemented
**** TODO `first`, `rest`, `nth`, `empty?`, `elem?`, `any?`, `all?`, `for-each`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `take`, `drop`, `conj` interface functions implemented for `list`, `vec`, `set`, `dict`, and `str` types.

** TODO Version 0.0.32 - faster dispatch
*** Goals
Improve the speed of method dispatch.

*** Target features
**** TODO Add cacheing to method dispatch

** TODO Version 0.0.33 - destructuring
*** Goals
Object destructuring helps cut down on the number of parentheses in many cases, so add
support for it at this point.

*** Target features
**** TODO Add support for `(cons head _)` destructuring syntax
**** TODO Add support for `(vec first .. last)` destructuring syntax
**** TODO Implement destructuring in `fun` and `let` forms

** TODO Version 0.0.34 - struct types
*** Goals
There are obvious benefits, especially in a dynamic language, of types whose keys can
be added dynamically (as in `JavaScript`, `Python`, etc). However, these are terrible
for implementing data structures and algorithms. Rascal seeks to solve this by separating
user composite types into `struct`s and `record`s. 

`record`s, implemented in 0.0.25, will be implemented on top of `dict`s, and allow adding 
and removing keys at runtime. `struct`s, implemented in this update, are fixed, use
space much more efficiently, and (potentially) support more advanced type features.

*** Target features
**** TODO Add `struct` and `struct-type` support.
**** TODO Add support for `(type [.. <fields>])` syntax.
