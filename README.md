# Rascal
The first serious version of rascal, a new functional dynamic language inspired by (stealing ideas from) Julia, Elixir, Scheme, and Clojure.

# Features
* Elixir-inspired syntax.
* Mostly-hygienic macros.
* Intrinsic multimethods (every function is generic).
* Algebraic effects.
* Others to come.
