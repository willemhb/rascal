# rascal
A little lisp with big dreams.

# next up
* <strike>Closures</strike>
* `load` (disk IO)
* Exceptions
* Macros
* `c-call` (basic FFI)
* Tail calls

# medium term
* Fancy immutable collection types (Vec, Map, Bin)
* Arity overloading (baby step toward generic functions)
* Better variable semantics
* Metadata maybe??
* Actual debugging info
* First class types
* User-defined types
* Union types
* Module system
* Reader extensions
* Standard library??
* Self-hosted compiler

# far future
* Julia style generic functions
* Algebraic effects or something (ideally exceptions would be rewritten in terms of the whatever general control-flow construct I end up implementing)
* New syntax
* Standard library
* Actually fast GC
